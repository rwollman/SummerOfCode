# Summer Of Code (SoC)

**Surf the exciting waves of science! Share your Jupyter and R markdown notebooks!**  

In SoC 2020 we'll be sharing tips and tricks on how to create te perfect computational notebook. Surfing [tricks](https://youtu.be/K3ZoquiPwBQ) are so pre-pandemic :) 

Let's show them how you do it! Share with us your best computational notebooks, show us what you've got!   

We will meet weekly Wed at noon (PST) and go over 2 computational notebooks each week. Presenters will push annotated version of their notebook to this github repo to facilitate learning.

### Rules of thumb: 
* The ratio of markdown to code should be > 3:1. 
* Notebooks should accomplish one key task, keep it short and focused.  
* Show us your best data-viz tricks.  
* Label everything and use meaningful variable names. 
* Minimize dependencies to only the things you really need
* Assume we know nothing about your research
* Goal is the code - provide scientific background as needed (JIT)
* Push your notebook & html version of the notebook to this github *before* you show it. 
* Use whatever programming language you like (python, R, matlab, TrueBasic (?), etc.)
 
### Perfect Wave competition
In the end of the summer all participants can (re)submit their updated notebook to the *Perfect Wave* competition. All notebooks will be judged and the author of the perfect notebook will be awarded a year of bragging rights and the amazing [Endless Summer decal](https://www.amazon.com/SRongmao-Endless-Summer-Search-Perfect/dp/B07RP91CXP/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=perfect+wave+endless+summer&qid=1589384823&sprefix=cat+litter+sa&sr=8-4&x=0&y=0)
